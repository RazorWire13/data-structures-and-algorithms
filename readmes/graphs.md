# Challenge 20: Graphs
Implement basic functionality methods of a a 2d array - aka a Graph

## Challenge
Implement a Graph that should be represented as an adjacency list and includes the following:

`AddEdge()`
* Adds a new vertice to the graphs
* Include the ability to have a “weight”
* Bring in both the parent node, and the new node to be added

`GetNodes()`
* Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection

`GetNeighbors()`
* Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
* Bring in a given node
* Include the weight from the given node.

`Size()`
* Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n) Time and Space
