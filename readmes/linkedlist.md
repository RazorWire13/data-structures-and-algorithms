# Singly Linked List
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O should be O(1) for Linked Lists

## API
* INSERT takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* INCLUDES takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
* PRINT takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
