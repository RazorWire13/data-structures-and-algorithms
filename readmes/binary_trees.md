# Challenge 14: Binary Trees
Implement basic functionality methods of a binary tree

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node .
* Create a BinaryTree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which takes in a root node, and returns an array of the nodes.

* Create a BinarySearchTree class
* Define a method named add that adds a new node in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named search that brings in a value of node, and returns the node with the desired value.
